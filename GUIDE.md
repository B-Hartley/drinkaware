## Custom Drinks

The Drinkaware integration supports both predefined drink types and custom drinks that may be created in the Drinkaware app.

### Understanding Custom Drinks

Custom drinks are created within the Drinkaware app and are assigned unique IDs that work just like the predefined drink types. From the perspective of Home Assistant, there's no functional difference between a predefined drink type and a custom drink - both are identified by UUIDs.

### Some Known Custom Drinks

- Corona 330ml (`E44AE744-1318-4978-8C84-E143C2B0AE3B`): 4.5% ABV (derived from Lager)
- Wingman A.F. (`B515F736-F194-4ED4-A7A9-EA2D75CC51AD`): 0.5% ABV (derived from Lager)
- Tequila (`4DDB9B89-CCB5-471E-A03C-AC516AE4E821`): 45.0% ABV (custom version of standard Tequila)

### How to Find Custom Drink IDs

To find the ID of a custom drink:
- You'll need to use a network capture tool like MITM Proxy to inspect the traffic from the Drinkaware app
- Look for the `drinkId` parameter when a drink is added
- The "Drinks Today" sensor can also help by showing the raw drink data in its attributes

### Using Custom Drinks

If you have identified a custom drink ID:

```yaml
service: drinkaware.log_drink
data:
  account_name: "Bruce"
  drink_id: "1A2B3C4D-5E6F-7890-ABCD-EF1234567890"  # Your custom drink ID
  measure_id: "B59DCD68-96FF-4B4C-BA69-3707D085C407"  # Pint
  abv: 5.2  # Custom ABV if needed
  quantity: 1
```

## Note on API Limitations

The Drinkaware API may have rate limiting in place, so avoid making too many service calls in a short period of time. If you encounter errors like "Rate limit exceeded," the integration will automatically wait and retry after a brief delay.
